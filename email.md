Other forms: **[[emailed]]; [[emails]]; [[emailing]]**
_[[Email]]_ is an electronic [[message]] that's sent from one [[computer]] to another. When you receive good news in an _email_, you can forward the message to your friends and family.

Most email these days uses the [[Internet]] for connecting the sender and recipient. Unlike some other kinds of [[messaging]], when you send an email to a friend, she doesn't have to be [[online]] at the same time to get your [[message]].
The next time she checks her [[email account]], your email will be waiting for her. _[[Email]]_, sometimes spelled _[[e-mail]]_, is short for _electronic mail_, and was coined in the early 1980s.
